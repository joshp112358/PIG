	<h1> PIG</h1>

	<h2> How the simulator works </h3>
		Pig is a game for 2 to 6 players. Players take turns rolling a die as many times as they like. If a roll is a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, the player adds that many points to their score for the turn. A player may choose to end their turn at any time and “bank” their points. If a player rolls a 1, they lose all their unbanked points and their turn is over.
		
		<p>

		Beginner Game: The first player to score 50 or more points wins. Advanced Game: The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
		<p>

		Players will ultimately develop a strategy in the form roll n times or until hand value is greater than or equal to p. 
		<p>
		<b>N</b>  is referred to as the roll limit and <b>p</b> the hand limit.
